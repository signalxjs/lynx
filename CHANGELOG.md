## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `@sigx/lynx-cli` 0.3.0 — `sigx dev` picker now shows available (shutdown) iOS simulators and (offline) Android AVDs as inline selectable entries, sorted by most-recently-used. Selecting one boots/launches it and proceeds to install + run the app. Previously the picker only listed *currently live* targets and required navigating an extra "+ Boot iOS simulator…" / "+ Launch Android emulator…" sub-picker; cold-start UX is now one-keystroke. `sigx dev --android` / `--all` also auto-launch the most-recent AVD when no Android device is connected, mirroring the existing iOS auto-boot fallback. Toolchain absent (no Xcode simulators, no AVDs) still degrades to a clear empty-state message. Fixes signalxjs/lynx#14.
- `@sigx/lynx-cli` 0.2.0 — pretty-print `xcodebuild` and `gradle` output by default for `sigx run:ios`, `sigx run:android`, and `sigx dev`'s native build paths. A cold iOS build used to dump ~16k lines of clang invocations that looked identical line-to-line; users assumed the build was looping. Output is now filtered to top-level action lines (`▸ Compiling [N] Target/file.cc`, `▸ Linking …`, `▸ Signing …`, `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`) with errors and warnings always surfaced. Gradle output similarly collapses `UP-TO-DATE`/`NO-SOURCE` tasks and indents ninja CXX progress. If `xcbeautify` is installed (`brew install xcbeautify`), iOS output is piped through it instead — auto-detected, never required. New `--verbose` flag (also `SIGX_VERBOSE=1` / `SIGX_VERBOSE_XCODEBUILD=1`) restores raw streaming for diagnostics. Zero new npm dependencies. Fixes signalxjs/lynx#15.
- Initial extraction of `@sigx/lynx*`, `@sigx/lynx-runtime*`, `@sigx/lynx-cli`, and `@sigx/lynx-testing` from `signalxjs/core` into a dedicated repository.
- `@sigx/lynx` un-privatized: first publishable build with `index`, `jsx-runtime`, and `jsx-dev-runtime` entry points.
- `@sigx/lynx-daisyui` un-privatized: first publishable build with shared CSS asset copy.
- Native modules (`@sigx/lynx-{camera,clipboard,device-info,file-system,haptics,image-picker,linking,location,network,notifications,permissions,safe-area,share,storage}`) now ship `sigx-module.json` for `@sigx/lynx-cli` auto-linking.
- npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) release workflow.
- `RELEASING.md` with dist-tag strategy (publish to `@beta` first, soak, promote to `@latest`).

### Fixed

- `@sigx/lynx` 0.1.2 — `0.1.1` was published with `"@sigx/lynx-runtime": "workspace:^"` unresolved in its dependencies (an earlier publish bypassed `pnpm publish -r`'s rewrite). `pnpm install` would fail with `ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND` for any consumer.
- `@sigx/lynx-plugin` 0.2.5 — `0.2.4` was published referencing the obsolete `@sigx/runtime-lynx-internal` (the pre-rename name). Republished against the canonical `@sigx/lynx-runtime-internal`.
- `@sigx/lynx-runtime` 0.2.4, `@sigx/lynx-runtime-internal` 0.2.4, `@sigx/lynx-runtime-main` 0.2.4 — first publish under the renamed names. The old `@sigx/runtime-lynx*` packages on npm are orphaned tarballs from the `signalxjs/core` era.
- `@sigx/lynx-dev-client` 0.1.1 — `sigx-module.json` was listed in `exports` but missing from `files`, so the published tarball didn't contain the manifest. Without it, `@sigx/lynx-cli` couldn't auto-discover the package and iOS builds failed with "cannot find SigxDevClient in scope".
- `@sigx/lynx-cli` 0.1.1 — `scaffoldAndroid` now force-chmods `gradlew` to 0o755 after copy. npm normalizes file modes to 0o644 in tarballs (except `bin` entries), so the exec bit set on the template was being stripped during publish — consumers got a non-executable `gradlew`.

### Deferred

- `@sigx/lynx-navigation` remains private in v0.1: depends on the unreleased `@sigx/motion`. Will ship in a follow-up release.
